**1.1 Rotation (10 Points)**
**Fig. 1(b) was generated by:**
**1. Multiplying Fig. 1(a) by (−1)^(x+y) ;**
**2. Computing the discrete Fourier transform;**
**3. Taking the complex conjugate of the transform;**
**4. Computing the inverse discrete Fourier transform;**
**5. Multiplying the real part of the result by (−1) x+y .**
**Explain (mathematically) why Fig. 1(b) appears as it does**

Assume that the origin image is:
$$
F = f(x,y)
$$
1.Multiplying Fig. 1(a) by (−1) x+y :
$$
F' = f'(x,y) = f(x,y)\cdot(-1)^{x+y}
$$
2. Computing the discrete Fourier transform;
$$
F^*_{Ft} = Ft(F') = Ft(f(x,y)(-1)^{x+y}) = f_{Ft}(j\omega_x, j\omega_y)
$$
3. Taking the complex conjugate of the transform;
$$
F_{Ft}' = F^*_{Ft}  = f^*_{Ft}(j\omega_x, j\omega_y)
$$
4. Computing the inverse discrete Fourier transform;
$$
\because h'^*(x,y)\Leftarrow FT\Rightarrow h_{FT}^*(j\omega_x,j\omega_y)
$$
$$
\therefore g'(x,y) =invFT(f^*_{Ft}(j\omega_x, j\omega_y)) = f'^*(x,y) = f'(-x,-y)
$$
5. Multiplying the real part of the result by (−1) x+y .
$$
g(x,y) = g'(x,y)\times(-1)^{x+y} = f'(-x,-y)\times(-1)^{x+y}
$$
So the result image is shown below:
$$
g(x,y) = f(-x,-y)
$$

**1.2 Fourier Spectrum (10 Points)**
**The (centered) Fourier spectrum in Fig. 2(b) corresponds to the original image Fig. 2(a), and the (centered) Fourier spectrum in Fig. 2(d) was obtained after Fig. 2(a) was padded with zeros (shown in Fig. 2(c)). Explain the significant increase in signal strength along the vertical and horizontal axes of Fig. 2(d) compared with Fig. 2(b).**
Fourier Spectrum has the following properties：
1. Considering the symmetry of the Fourier transform, in order to facilitate the display, the Fourier spectrum is usually based on the center of the image(the original point). Each part of the image is about the origin of symmetry.
2. The original point of the the Fourier spectrum is the "zero frequency point" which is the average gray value of the image containing the general information. And from center to the edge of the spectrum, the frequency is increasing and indicates the details of the image.
3. In the center of the frequency domain, the obvious change direction is vertical to the surface of the original image. In other words, if the obvious change direction in the original image is vertical, then the obvious change direction in frequency domain is horizontal.

For the image Figure2(a) and Figure2(c):
We padded zeros in Figure2(c), and also note that we add high frequency component for the edge in the image. Because we can see it clearly that the edge of the image is trend to 255 but the padding is 0. So from the edge to the padding, we got high frequency.
According to the properties I describe before, we can know that both the vertical and horizontal axes will be strengthened in frequency domain.
For both vertical and horizontal axes in original image, the edge makes a big change in the border of the padding in Figure2(c), but not in Figure3(a). As a result, we got a  different Fourier Spectrum from Figure2(c) with more high frequency component in both vertical and horizontal axes.

**1.3 Lowpass and Highpass (5 ∗ 2 = 10 Points)**
**1. Find the equivalent filter H(u, v) in the frequency domain for the following spatial filter:**
$$
  \begin{matrix}
   1 & 2 & 1  \\
   0 & 0 & 0 \\
   -1 & -2 & -1
  \end{matrix} 
  $$

Assume the matrix is f(x,y)
$$
f'(x,y) = f(x,y) \cdot (-1)^{x+y}
$$
And we get:
$$
  \begin{matrix}
   1 & -2 & 1  \\
   0 & 0 & 0 \\
   -1 & 2 & -1
  \end{matrix} 
  $$
$$
F(u,v) = \frac{1}{MN}\sum_{x=0}^{M-1}\sum_{y=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)e^{-j2\pi(ux/M+vy/N)}
$$
